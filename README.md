The object of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round, the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. Once a category has been used, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others where the score depends on the value of the dice.

A winner is determined by the highest score at the end of the last round. In the event of a tie, both players win.


##How to Play
Players will take turns interacting with the dice and score card areas. To roll the dice, click the *Roll Dice* button. After the roll, decide which dice to use to score by clicking them. When ready, select the appropriate category in the score card to populate your score.
